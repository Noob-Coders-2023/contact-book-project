Build a Contact Book With Python, PyQt, and SQLite

Step 1: Creating the Contact Book’s Skeleton App With PyQt

- In this first step, we’ll create a minimal but functional PyQt GUI application to provide the foundation on which we’ll start building the contact book.
We’ll also create the minimal required project structure, including the project’s main package and an entry-point script to run the application.

Step 2: Building the Contact Book’s GUI With Python

- Now that you’ve built the skeleton of your contact book application, you can start coding the main window’s GUI.
At the end of this section, you’ll have completed the required steps to create the GUI of your contact book using Python and PyQt.

Step 3: Setting Up the Contact Book’s Database

- At this point, we’ve created a PyQt application and its main window’s GUI to build our contact book project. In this section, we’ll write code to define how the application connects to the contact database. To complete this step, we’ll use SQLite to handle the database and PyQt’s SQL support to connect the application to the database and to work with our contact data.
