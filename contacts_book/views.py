# 'from PyQt5.QtWidgets import' is importing classes and functions from the PyQt5.QtWidgets module,
# which is a module within the PyQt5 library
# that provides tools and components for creating GUI applications.

# 'from .model import ContactsModel' import ContactsModel from model.py.

# 'QAbstractItemView' to provide access to the table view selection behavior policy.

# 'QHBoxLayout' is a class in PyQt5 that represents a horizontal layout.
# Layouts are used in GUI development to arrange widgets
# (such as buttons, labels, or other GUI elements) within a window or dialog in a specific way.

# 'QMainWindow' is a class in PyQt5 that represents the main application window.
# It provides a framework for building GUI applications with a menu bar, toolbar, and central widget area.

# 'QPushButton' to create the Add, Delete, and Clear All buttons.

# 'QTableView' to provide the table-like view that displays the contacts list.

# 'QWidget' is a fundamental class in PyQt5 that represents a generic widget.
# Widgets are the basic building blocks of GUI applications in PyQt5, and they can be used to create various UI elements.

# With this code, these classes are being imported,
# which means you can use them in your code to create and manage GUI elements and layouts when building a PyQt5 application.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 'class Window(QMainWindow)' defines a new class named Window that inherits from the QMainWindow class.

# 'def __init__(self, parent=None)' defines the constructor (__init__ method) for the Window class.
# It takes an optional parent argument, which is typically used to specify the parent widget of this widget.

# 'super().__init__(parent)' calls the constructor of the parent class (QMainWindow) and passes the parent argument to it.
# This ensures that the initialization code of QMainWindow is executed before any additional initialization specific to the Window class.

# self.setWindowTitle("Contact Book") sets the window's title to "Contact Book"

# self.resize(550, 250) sets the initial size of the window to a width of 550 pixels and a height of 250 pixels.


# self.centralWidget = QWidget() creates a central widget for the main window.
# The central widget is where you typically place other widgets and layout managers to build the user interface of your application.


# self.setCentralWidget(self.centralWidget) sets the central widget for the main window to the one created above.
# This means that any widgets or layouts you add to this centralWidget will be displayed in the main window.


# self.layout = QHBoxLayout() creates a horizontal layout (QHBoxLayout) and assigns it to the self.layout attribute of the Window instance.
# Layouts are used to arrange widgets within a window or container.


# self.centralWidget.setLayout(self.layout) sets the layout of the central widget to the horizontal layout created earlier.
# This means that any widgets added to this layout will be horizontally arranged within the central widget.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overall, these lines of code set up the main window for a PyQt5 application, including its title, size, central widget, and layout.
# You can add more widgets and customize the user interface further within this window class to create your application.
